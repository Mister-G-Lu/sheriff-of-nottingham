  "title": "Sheriff of Nottingham",
  "intro": "You are the newly appointed inspector at Nottingham's eastern gate. Each dawn, carts and merchants crowd before your post, swearing their bags hold nothing but honest bread, cheese, and chickens.\n\nBut the Prince demands higher taxes, smugglers grow bolder, and the people whisper that Sheriffs grow fat while they go hungry. Your reputation will rise or fall with every bag you open—or every lie you let walk past you."
